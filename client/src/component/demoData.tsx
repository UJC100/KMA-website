That is why I believe I have a mountain of Influence to conquer in order to establish God’s agenda in the world and be a blessing to my generation. It started many years ago when to survive as a university student I used to teach French and English to teenagers in my community and High Schools in my neighbourhood. Being a Sunday School instructor has helped me fashion teachings according to the audience and grow in public speaking.  I had the Aprivilege to volunteer in Cameroon during some conferences with themes related to  women empowerment. I am a trained journalist. I had the opportunity to carry out investigations as a student in the University of Buea. On one of the videos featured on my YouTube Channel, I interviewed a young man who nearly got scammed by a Network Marketing company. I look at life as a journey. And in this journey, I love to capture people’s experiences and turn them into inspiring stories. Destiny is greater than death. Live as if you only had today to make impact and leave a legacy.",

      "Since I was a child, I've grown up alongside my older sister, who suffers from mental health problems. I saw my parents do everything they could to help her, often without any tangible result. This silent suffering, combined with a deep sense of powerlessness, awakened in me a burning desire to understand God and His ability to restore lives. It was this quest that led me to commit myself fully to a mission: to raise awareness of the importance of mental, psychic and spiritual well-being. For me, coachingis much more than a tool: it's a calling. It enables me to accompany people towards a life that is free, fulfilled and centred on their true identity. Today, my greatest battle is to participate in the inner restoration of individuals so that they can experience the peace, healing and true joy that only God can offer.",

      "I am a gospel singer with a heart for uplifting spirits and drawing people closer to God through music. My songs are a testimony of God’s grace, and every note I sing is an offering of gratitude to Him. Beyond music, I am also a finance analyst with a passion for combining creativity, faith, and business insight to make a positive impact. My musical journey began at the age of 12, singing in my church choir. Long before that, I would sing at home with my brothers, inspired by my mother, who taught me to mean every word I sing. For me, music has always been more than a sound—it is a way to express my emotions, release my anxieties, and connect with the audience God has entrusted to me. I believe that every person is a gift of God to the world, and our responsibility is to make ourselves useful to His purpose. I have written many songs, and though I was once unsure if they would touch people, the feedback from my first release gave me the courage to keep going. At first, I struggled with comparing myself to famous artists, but joining KMA Academy changed my perspective. They taught me to believe in myself, embrace my unique gift, and love the voice God has given me. In addition to music, I carry a strong business mindset. With KMA’s guidance, I started a small perfume business, JK Smell Attraction, which sustained me during a difficult season of unemployment. That experience reminded me that trying is the first step toward success, and that failure is not an end, but a stage of growth. As I always say: the only real mistake is the one we learn nothing from. Today, I continue to grow in both music and business. I hold a three-year college certification in Business Informatics and currently serve as a Finance Analyst at Amazon. My journey reflects resilience, faith, and the pursuit of excellence—both in song and in service.",
