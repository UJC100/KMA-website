That is why I believe I have a mountain of Influence to conquer in order to establish God’s agenda in the world and be a blessing to my generation. It started many years ago when to survive as a university student I used to teach French and English to teenagers in my community and High Schools in my neighbourhood. Being a Sunday School instructor has helped me fashion teachings according to the audience and grow in public speaking.  I had the Aprivilege to volunteer in Cameroon during some conferences with themes related to  women empowerment. I am a trained journalist. I had the opportunity to carry out investigations as a student in the University of Buea. On one of the videos featured on my YouTube Channel, I interviewed a young man who nearly got scammed by a Network Marketing company. I look at life as a journey. And in this journey, I love to capture people’s experiences and turn them into inspiring stories. Destiny is greater than death. Live as if you only had today to make impact and leave a legacy."
